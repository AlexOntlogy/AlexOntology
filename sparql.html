            <h3>A LOD Project - The Linked Open Data Environment</h3>
            <h4>Anastasija Romanov - An intriguing historical figure</h4>
            <p class ="descr">Grand Duchess Anastasija Nikolaevna Romanov (18 June 1901 – 17 July 1918) was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, the last sovereign of Imperial Russia, and his wife Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. She lived just seventeen years because the night of July 16-17, 1918, Anastasia and her family were executed in Yekaterinburg, Russia. But in the years following the Romanovs’ murders, speculation arose as to whether she and her brother, Alexei Nikolaevich, might have survived the execution. Rumors circulated that they were shielded from the bullets by family jewels that had been sewn into their clothing for safekeeping. The location of their bodies was unknown until 2007. 
                <br>
                Anastasia's fate was particularly apt to these conjectures, as many women claiming to be the Grand Duchess periodically surfaced. Among the best known of these women there was Anna Anderson (aka Franziska Schanzkowska), who, beginning in the early 1920s fought to prove herself the rightful claimant of Anastasia’s inheritance. Anderson's suit was rejected in 1970, and the mystery of the Grand Duchess Anastasia remained unsolved. 
                <br>
                In the 1970s an amateur archaeologist found a shallow grave containing the well-aged skeletons of six adults and three children. He suppressed these findings from the public until the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s. A forensic investigation in 1991 identified the nine bodies as belonging to Anastasia’s family members and servants, but Anastasia and her brother's bodies still appeared to be missing. In the end, in 2007 a new DNA analysis of another grave, discovered near the first, conclusively identified Anastasia and Alexei's bodies, closing the door on nearly 90 years of mystery and speculation. 
                <br>
                Even if Anastasija’s mystery is not a mystery anymore, we have been fascinated by this story as well as many other people. Infact, Anastasia's dubious whereabouts inspired books, plays and movies. The purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of cinema, including the 1997 animated film (that we all loved) and the 1956 Academy Award-winning film starring legendary actress Ingrid Bergman, made-for-television films, and a Broadway musical.</p>
            <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p class ="descr">The key concept of the project Anastasija RomanLOD relies on the idea that it is possible to describe an historical person, in a full ranging perspective, starting from the connections between the person itself and other heterogenous entities, including real items coming from the different domains of libraries, archives and museums. In order to do that, we explored the possibilities offered by the technologies used in Semantic Web, such as vocabularies, ontologies, RDF and URIs. Therefore, the project’s aim is to model an organized linked open data environment that connects concepts, items, people, places, events and, more generally, data and information about Anastasija Romanov, in the most interoperable and semantically meaningful way possible. </p>

                        <p><b>Article Abstract</b> <br> Alexithymia is a sub-clinical construct, traditionally characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions. Despite the clear need for interoception (interpreting physical signals from the body) when identifying one's own emotions, little research has focused on the selectivity of this impairment. While it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion, recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non-affective interoceptive signals, such as one's heart rate. […] In order to determine whether alexithymia is associated with selectively impaired affective interoception, or general interoceptive impairment, we investigated the association between alexithymia and self-reported non-affective interoceptive ability, and the extent to which individuals perceive similarity between affective and non-affective states (both measured using questionnaires developed for the purpose of the current study)[…]. <br>

                <p class="subheading-text">A gradual process of mapping, abstraction and analysis was made upon the domain of study.  After a first representation through a Conceptual Map and an E/R Model, the Metadata Standards used by the different institutions to describe the items were analysed and aligned. The last two steps of the Knowledge Organization of Anastasija RomanLOD were the creation of a Theoretical Model, to expand the relationships already highlighted, to create new links between our items and others, and to add more information, and its formalization through predicates from already existing schemas, vocabularies and ontologies, i.e. the Conceptual Model. 
                    We created all the following graphs with diagrams.net (formerly draw.io), a free online diagram software, very intuitive and easy to use.</p>

                            <p class="analysis">So to start with our Knowledge Organization process, we represented our domain scenario and the ten selected items through a Conceptual Map.  
                            Anastasjia Romanov is the centre of our project, and she appears also as the centre of a complex net, to which various rays are connected. Each ray brings to a particular object somehow connected to the Grand Duchess; at this stage we tried also to highlight some crucial people, places and events that make our entities interconnected with each other. </p>

                            <p class="analysis">We have produced this metadata analyisis starting from the standards used by the institutions from which we gained information about the items. When these standards were not specified by the institutions, we have looked up for the most suitable ones in order to describe the objects according to their kind. Information about the specific standards as well as the reasons why we have adopted each of them in this analysis can be read below.

The aim of the task is to reach a high degree of interoperability of data and, because of this, using the Dublin Core standard as the reference for the alignment, we decided to add other standards to the ones found during the metadata analysis. In particular, we added FRBRoo and CIDOC/CRM:

In 1994 the work focused on developing an entity-relationship model for museum information, but, in 1996, the approach shifted to object-oriented modelling methodologies, resulting in the first version of the CIDOC CRM in 1999. The process of standardizing this standard ended in 2006 with its acceptance as the ISO 21127 standard; </li> 
                                <br>

FRBRoo was born with the aim to facilitate the integration, mediation, and interchange of bibliographic and museum information. </li>

                            <p class="analysis">At this point, we have enlarged our focus at the formal level of representation exploiting the powerful tool of the ontologies. We have looked for the most appropriate schemas, vocabularies and ontologies for matching the terms previously used for describing our entities and properties in natural language. In particular, it can be noticed that:                                 
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="normal"> FaBiO, FRBRoo, MODS and CIDOC CRM have been used for describing textual as well as visual items and the properties related to them;</li>

                            <p class="analysis">Here it is possible to visualize a table for each of our items. The tables are composed of three columns representing the three components of a triple (subject, predicate and object). Subjects and objects have been expressed in natural language, while predicates have been written using some ontology properties. There is a row for each property related to the item-subject and in every row it is possible to read a triple statement. </p>

                            <p class="analysis"> In this section, RDF data about some of our items are available. We have decided to create RDF triples referring to <b>four</b> of our items in order to represent four different kinds of objects and their peculiar features. RDF triples have been indeed produced for the <b>film </b> <u><a href="#item7">Anastasia (1956)</a></u>, the <b>Photograph </b> <u><a href="#item2">Family Portrait</a></u>, <b>the song </b> <u><a href="#item9">Once Upon a December</a></u>, <b>the book</b> <u><a href="#item6">Through the Russian Revolution</a></u>. The URIs identifying our items have been created by us basing on the format provided on the w3id.org website, but have not been activated. The URIs representing the entities related to each item, together with the prefixes for the chosen ontologies can be read in the boxes below. Links to the same authorities for names (owl:sameAs) have been provided. We have also provided semantic connections between our items and other related cultural elements (for example the play on which the film is based) or historical events (like the Russian Revolution, which is the subject of the book). Partitive associations have been made, for example, between the song and a musical containing it, and other associative connections have been made for people and places. The triples have been written in Turtle format.
